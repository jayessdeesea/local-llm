# Active Context

## Recent Changes
- Optimized resource allocation for 96 GiB system
  - Increased Ollama memory limits to 32Gi
  - Increased Ollama CPU limits to 8 cores
  - Adjusted frontend resources for better performance
  - Increased persistent storage to 20Gi
- Switched back to phi4 model with higher memory allocation
- Updated documentation to reflect new resource specifications

## Current Focus
- Testing and validation of high-memory configuration
- Performance optimization with increased resources
- Documentation updates
- Model performance validation

## Active Decisions
- Optimized resource allocation for high-memory system
- Using phi4 model for better capabilities
- Balanced memory allocation between model and system
- Increased persistent storage for model data
- Using Helm charts as primary deployment method

## Next Steps
1. Test deployment with new resource allocations
2. Validate phi4 model performance
3. Monitor memory usage and performance
4. Fine-tune resource allocations based on monitoring data
