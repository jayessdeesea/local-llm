# Project Brief: Local LLM Web UI

## Project Overview
Building an open web UI application to interface with a Phi-4 language model instance, deployed in Kubernetes on local Docker Desktop for Windows.

## Core Requirements
1. Web-based user interface for interacting with Phi-4 model
2. Kubernetes deployment on Docker Desktop
3. Local deployment capability
4. Integration with Phi-4 language model

## Technical Goals
1. Create a containerized web application
2. Implement Kubernetes manifests for deployment
3. Set up Phi-4 model container and service
4. Establish communication between UI and model
5. Ensure proper resource management and scaling

## Success Criteria
- Web UI successfully communicates with Phi-4 model
- Application runs smoothly in local Kubernetes cluster
- Responsive and user-friendly interface
- Efficient resource utilization
- Proper error handling and reliability

## Constraints
- Must run on Windows with Docker Desktop
- Local deployment only
- Resource limitations of local environment

## Timeline
Initial development phase focusing on:
1. Basic UI implementation
2. Kubernetes setup
3. Phi-4 integration
4. Testing and optimization
